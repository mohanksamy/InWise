Reasons Picking ReactJS over other frameworks or libraries:
- ReactJS is a library than a framework compared to AngularJS, one of the popular framework
- We could choose framework like AngularJS but how much we make use of the framework is a open question
- Framework will be a over kill on the performance when at least 30% of the features are not being used

Advantages of ReactJS compared to any other libraries / frameworks:
- Works with Virtual DOM than actual DOM
- HTML will be embedded into JavaScript unlike in other JS libraries JS will be embedded in HTML


- Lightweight DOM For Better Performance
- Easy Learning Curve
- A desired interface can be created in a relatively easy manner
- Components Support And Little Dependencies
